			<p>
				Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a
				communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young.
				Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a
				"pecking order", with dominant individuals having priority for food
				access and nesting locations.

			<!-- </article> -->
			<p>
				Beef from steers and heifers is similar. Depending on economics, the
				number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls,
				because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for mince (known as
				ground beef in the United States).
